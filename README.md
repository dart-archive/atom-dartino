[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dartino/atom-dartino.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dartino/atom-dartino)

This package is a [Dartino](http://dartino.github.io/sdk/)
and [SoD](https://github.com/domokit/sod) development plugin
for [Atom](https://atom.io)
built on top of the Atom [dartlang](https://atom.io/packages/dartlang) plugin.

## Features

and [Dartino](http://dartino.github.io/sdk/) applications.

This is very preliminary Atom plugin... much work and cleanup still to be done.
