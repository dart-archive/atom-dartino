# Keybindings require three things to be fully defined: A selector that is
# matched against the focused element, the keystroke and the command to execute.
# For more detailed documentation see
# https://atom.io/docs/latest/behind-atom-keymaps-in-depth.

# Global commands
'atom-workspace':
  'ctrl-f6': 'dartino:run-app-on-device'
  'ctrl-alt-shift-f6': 'dartino:rebuild-restart-dev'
